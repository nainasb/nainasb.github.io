Hi! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm advised by professor [**Hari Sundaram**](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu). I do work at the intersection of social network analysis and game theory, and my focus is on understanding human decision-making via modeling and simulation as well as participatory methods. 

Currently, I'm working on two research tracks: 

1. Modeling community and institutional trust, and designing interventions to increase that trust.
2. Understanding incentives for people to participate in systems that might save them money, or otherwise increase their well-being.
