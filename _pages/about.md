Hi! I'm a 6th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm advised by professor [Hari Sundaram](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu). I work at the intersection of social network analysis and game theory, and focus on understanding human decision-making via modeling and simulation. I've spent the last semester interviewing local community members to contextualize my models, so they can be useful tools for organizations in Champaign.

My work largely falls into two categories:

1. Modeling trust between communities and large institutions, and designing interventions to increase that trust.
2. Designing fairness-promoting systems that users are incentivized to participate in.

I'm currently on the job market looking for Teaching Faculty positions! You can find my teaching record in my [CV](../assets/pdf/Naina_CV_2024.pdf), and feel free to contact me for additional teaching materials.

And if you're confused, maybe you're looking for my [brother](https://nbalepur.github.io) :grin:
