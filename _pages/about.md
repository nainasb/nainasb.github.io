Hi! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I'm advised by professor [**Hari Sundaram**](https://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu). My work is at the intersection of social network analysis and game theory, and focuses on attempting to understand human decision-making via modeling and simulation as well as participatory methods.
